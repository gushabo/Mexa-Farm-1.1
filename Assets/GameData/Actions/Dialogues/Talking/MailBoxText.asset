  - ' Good morning young man, my name is Rafa but everyone calls me Don Rafa'
  - next to me as you can see there is a mailbox
  - 'The fee to pay me is placed in this mailbox: D'
  - I am renting you this large piece of land that I have not used for a long time,
    so you can see that it is a bit neglected
  - Your job will be to expand it and live on what you plant and they can give you
    the animals if you get to have some.
  - You can find more people in the town as well as my friend Juan, he is a man with
    a big beard, he sells the seeds of the crops and buys what has already grown
  - In fact, he is the one who is here next to me, talk to him so that you can also
    see what he says to you.
  - ' And please remember to pay me every 5 days if you don''t do it on the sixth
    I will charge you double and if you owe me for more than 10 days I will expel
    you from my land'
