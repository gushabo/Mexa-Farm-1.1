  - Hello, you must be the new one in town
  - ' I am Sebastian as you can see and I love to fish and look there is a fish right
    in that lake you should try to catch it'
  - when you try it you will have a minigame to catch it if you look closely you
    will have 2 columns
  - The one on the left is where you will try to catch the fish trying to keep the
    fish within the green box that you move by clicking the mouse.
  - If you click on it, the box will go up and if you don't press it, it will go
    down, the second column on the left is, so to speak, your process bar, it will
    fill up as you keep the weight inside the box
  - when it is completely filled you will win if time passes and you do not fill
    the bar you will lose
  - good luck catching it :D
