  - ' Hello, Welcome to Mexa farm'
  - ' Here you will have to plant and raise animals to earn money'
  - ' I will give you some advice so that you know what to do'
  - To start, each action you take will take away energy, which is the bar that you
    have at the bottom of your screen.
  - At the top you have the clock and your coins
  - Finally, remember to visit the town, which is where you can buy and sell your
    things.
  - I will be there to make you feel more comfortable and remember that if you need
    some seeds I can sell them to you and I can buy what you get from those seeds.
